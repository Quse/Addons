Information for addon authors
-----------------------------

Supporting the CUSTOM_CLASS_COLORS standard is simple. All you need to
do is check for the existence of a global CUSTOM_CLASS_COLORS table, and
read from it instead of RAID_CLASS_COLORS if it exists.

If your addon uses a local upvalue (variable) for RAID_CLASS_COLORS or
keeps a local cache of class colors, you should either delay creating
the upvalue or cache until the PLAYER_LOGIN event fires, or update it
when PLAYER_LOGIN fires. You should also register for a callback to be
notified when class colors are changed so you can update your cache or
apply the new colors immediately.

Finally, please do not check for the !CustomClassColors addon by name as
a means of determining whether the user has custom class colors. Not
only is it not guaranteed that !CustomClassColors will be loaded before
your addon unless you clutter up your TOC file by listing it as an
optional dependency, but the CUSTOM_CLASS_COLORS format is meant to be a
community standard and can be implemented by any addon, including an
unpublished one the user has written for personal use!
